#About


This PHP library allows you to connect with a Maniaplanet Server to display e.g. the current players on your website. It´s a rewrite of the originally with the dedicated server deliverd GbxRemote.inc.php. It was a test if the php build in xmlrpc library is faster than a self written one. Some tests have shown that this isn´t the case for a small acount of requests. However if you are using this library with a servercontroller wtih frequent requests you will get better speed and workload.
